# Capstone-Project

Project Title: Chest X -Ray Classifier 
Project Summary:  
•	Objective - The project is aimed at classifying the X-rays of patients diagnosed with viral and bacterial infections such as SARS, MERS, ARDS and COVID 19.  
Goals: 
1.	Develop an approach to differentiate multiple infections from chest X-ray images, identifying the probability of a given image shows infection
2.	Develop a machine learning model to classify the X-rays of patients as healthy or infected.
Research Methods – o Image Analysis, Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Learning 
Milestones:  
•	Data Preparation 
•	Exploratory Data Analysis 
•	Predictive Models
